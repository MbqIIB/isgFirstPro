 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI (using the gsk7ikm command on UNIX, or the strmqikm command on Windows).
 2.   From the Key Database File menu, click New. The New window is displayed.
 3.    Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System).
 4.   In the File Name field, type a file name. This field already contains the text key.kdb. If your stem name is key, leave this field unchanged. If you have specified a different stem name, replace key with your stem name but you must not change the .kdb.
 5.   In the Location field, type the path, for example:
        For a queue manager: /var/mqm/qmgrs/QM1/ssl (on UNIX) or C:\Program Files\IBM\WebSphere MQ\qmgrs\QM1\ssl (on Windows)

        The path must match the value of the SSLKeyRepository attribute of the queue manager.
        For a WebSphere MQ client: /var/mqm/ssl (on UNIX) or C:\mqm\ssl (on Windows)
  6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays.
  7.  Type a password in the Password field, and type it again in the Confirm Password field.
  8.  Select the Stash the password to a file check box.
    Note: If you do not stash the password, attempts to start SSL channels fail because they cannot obtain the password required to access the key database file.
  9.  Click OK. A window is displayed, confirming that the password is in file key.sth (unless you specified a different stem name).
  10. Click OK. The Signer Certificates window is displayed, containing a list of the CA certificates that are provided with iKeyman and pre-installed in the key database.
  11.  Start of changeRemove these CA certificates by selecting them and clicking Delete.End of change
  12. Set the access permissions, as described in Accessing and securing your key database files on Windows or Accessing and securing your key database files on UNIX systems.

Using the command line
Use the following commands to create a new CMS key database file using iKeycmd or GSKCapiCmd:

    On UNIX:

    gsk8capicmd -keydb -create -db ./key.kdb -pw mli123 -type cms -expire days
        -stash -fips 
		
## creating self signed cert
	gsk8capicmd -cert -create -db ./key.kdb -pw mli123 -label ibmwebspheremqwin_mli_app_qm
        -dn "cn=linux02.isphereglobal.com" -size 1024 -x509version 3 -sig_alg SHA1WithRSA -expire 365

## extracting the CA part of the cert

gsk8capicmd -cert -extract -db ./key.kdb -pw password -label ibmwebspheremqwin_mli_app_qm -target winmliappqmCA
        -format ascii
